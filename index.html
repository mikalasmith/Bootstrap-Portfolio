            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="assets/imgs/msmith.jpg" class="auth-image"  alt= "photo of Mikala" width:"20px;" height:"20px;">
            <p>Mikala Smith is a budding full stack
            web developer, currently attending UNCC's coding
            bootcamp program. She originally hails from Charlotte, NC, and considers
            Chapel Hill, NC to be her second home. She attended UNC-Chapel Hill and graduated 
            with a Bacherlor of Arts in Global Studies.</p>
              
            <p>She now works as an English Teaching Assistant at an elementary school. She likes to think of herself as doing her best
            to help craft the young minds of the next generation, or as her students would put it, "The lady who just <i>won't</i> let up on grammar."</p>
                  
            <p>Just last year, she lived in the quaint, and beautiful town of Albacete, Spain, where she also
            worked as an English Teaching Assistant, and did not let up on grammar with her students there either. 
            In her free time, she likes to travel whenever she can, and when she cannot, she likes to get lost
            in a good book, a good netflix series, or go on what she calls a "leisurely run", but what others may refer to
            as "walking." As technology continues to increase its prevalency in the classroom, she hopes to bridge her passion
            or teaching English with her new passion for coding to make a difference in the education system.</p>
